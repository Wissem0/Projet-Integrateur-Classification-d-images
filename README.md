- Train and test CNN (Microservice 1)
- Eventually build search data structure (Microservice 2)

### Playing the game :

- Determine existing features with CNN -> user attribute vector [1,-1,....,]
- Run the search algorithm from list_atr_celebra using user attribute vector. Score = percentage of common features between user and celebrity
- Display celebrity image with the ressemblance score (e.g. 68%) and mismatched attributes (e.g. Glasses, Pale Skin)
